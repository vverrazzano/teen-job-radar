**Teen Job Radar** is a free, location-aware web tool designed to empower teens in their search for safe, skill-building job opportunities. Whether you're looking for part-time work, seasonal roles, or your very first paycheck, this site helps you explore options that build real-world experience and align with your future goals.

Built with accessibility and simplicity in mind, Teen Job Radar includes:
- ✅ Curated job listings tailored to teens and entry-level applicants  
- 📍 Live job search links that adjust based on your location  
- 🧠 Interview prep tips and red flag warnings to help you navigate the hiring process  
- 📊 Skill-building scorecards to track growth and transferable abilities  
- 💬 Resources for making informed decisions and talking through offers with mentors  

This project was created to support teens—especially those in underserved communities—who may not have access to career counseling, job boards, or adult guidance. It’s open-source, community-driven, and designed to grow with your feedback.
